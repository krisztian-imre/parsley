article_title: Web3 Fantasy Adventures in 3 Minutes Chapter 2: The Birth of Bitcoin and Its Mysterious Creator
article_link: https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/41094
article: ## Introduction
In the previous chapter, Blocky and Gatsby discovered the wonders of the Magic Ledger (blockchain). Today, they will delve into the legend of the City of Trust and uncover the secrets behind the worlds first digital gold coin. Lets continue the journey and step further into the fantastical world of Web3!
## The Story
Ever since discovering the Magic Ledger, Blocky had been fascinated by the history of the City of Trust. One day, while wandering with Gatsby through an ancient library rumored to hold countless tales of the citys legends, they came across a dimly lit corner.
On a dusty shelf sat a book, its cover inscribed with the title: Satoshi Nakamoto: The Birth of Bitcoin.
Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Blocky asked softly.
Gatsby leaned in with a mysterious air. Satoshi Nakamoto is an enigmatic magician. He appeared during the City of Trusts greatest crisis and created the first digital gold coin-Bitcoin.
Digital gold coin? Blockys eyes widened with curiosity. Is it also recorded on the Magic Ledger?
Gatsby nodded. Exactly. Bitcoin was built upon the Magic Ledger. Satoshis creation transformed the entire city.
Gatsby opened the book and began recounting the legendary tale:
### The Chaotic Era
Long ago, the residents of the City of Trust used traditional gold coins for their transactions. However, these coins relied on the citys treasury for safekeeping, and the treasurys records were often prone to errors. Sometimes, the greed of certain treasury sorcerers even led to the loss of residents wealth.
Everyone longed for a more transparent and reliable monetary system, Gatsby explained. That was when Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin.
### The Birth of Bitcoin
Satoshi Nakamoto designed a unique digital gold coin, with every coin recorded on the Magic Ledger and generated through a process called mining.
Mining? Blocky asked, puzzled. What are they digging for?
Gatsby explained, Mining is a way to make the Magic Ledger more secure. Miners use their computational power to solve complex magical puzzles. When they solve a puzzle, they are rewarded with new Bitcoin.
Gatsby pointed to an illustration in the book: miners operating magical devices in a glowing mine. Each time a puzzle was successfully solved, a new Bitcoin was forged and recorded on the Magic Ledger.
Whats even more important, Gatsby continued, is that Satoshis design fixed the total supply of Bitcoin, ensuring it couldnt be endlessly increased by greedy sorcerers.
### The Mysterious Departure
Where is Satoshi Nakamoto now? Blocky asked curiously.
Gatsby shrugged. No one knows. After completing the initial design of Bitcoin, he vanished from sight. He left behind the foundation of Bitcoin and the Magic Ledger, enabling the residents of the City of Trust to continue building their own future.
### The Magical Powers of Bitcoin
Through this lesson, Blocky summarized Bitcoins three main characteristics:
**1. Decentralization: **Bitcoin doesnt rely on banks or central institutions; it is maintained by miners from around the globe.
**2. Scarcity: **Bitcoin has a limited supply of only 21 million coins, ensuring its value isnt diluted.
**3. Anonymity: **Every transaction is recorded on the ledger, but users identities remain anonymous, protecting their privacy.
After hearing the story, Blocky marveled, Satoshi truly was a great magician. His creation not only solved trust issues but also opened up new possibilities for the City of Trust.
**Stay Tuned for the Next Chapter**
Join Blocky and Gatsby as they continue to explore the boundless possibilities of Web3!

**Gate.io Pre-Market PreMint Introduction as follows:
What is Gate.io Pre-market PreMint?**
Pre-market PreMint allows investors to lock USDT to mint PreTokens and place orders in the trading market to earn profits in advance.
**PreMint Feature Highlights**
-Take Profits Early: The seller can sell PreToken at their favorable prices in the trading market without waiting and gain profits earlier.
-Trade Flexibly: The buyer can buy or sell PreToken at their favorable prices or wait for settlement, allowing for more adaptable trading strategies.
**PreMint Feature Rules**
1.The PreMint entry typically becomes available after the pre-market project begins trading. Users can lock USDT through the PreMint entry to mint PreTokens. Once minted, the corresponding PreToken balance will be added to the users account.
2.The PreToken trading market will open after a specific period once the pre-market project begins trading. Users can trade their minted PreTokens in the PreToken trading market, following the same rules as other trading pairs.
3.The PreMint entry and the PreToken trading market close before the pre-market project trading ends. After the market closes, a snapshot of each UIDs PreToken balance is taken and then cleared.
4.Users can mint PreTokens during the pre-market trading period and trade them in the trading market.
5.Users who pre-minted PreTokens need to deposit the corresponding project tokens before the settlement time and ensure there are enough project tokens in their accounts. The system will deduct the project tokens from the account and return the locked USDT to the users account.
6.After settlement, the system will automatically settle PreToken holders based on the snapshot taken before market closure. Users will then receive the real tokens and any penalty collateral from non-settling minting users.

###How do Sharkfin products bring you a return?
During the observation period, if the price of the target asset stays within the per-specified price range, investors can earn a higher annualized return. At settlement, the closer the target asset prices are to the upper limit of the price range, the higher the annual return.
During the observation period, if the price of the target asset has gone beyond the price range, users can obtain a guaranteed return. If, at 4:00 UTC on the settlement day, the price is above or below the per-specified price range, the product will be settled at the minimum annualized rate of return. If the price always stays within the price range, the rate of return will be determined according to where the BTC/USDT/USDT perpetual contract price falls on Gate.io at 4:00 UTC on the settlement day.
###How does the Double No-Touch products bring you a return?
1) During the observation period, if the price of the target asset stays within the price range (that is, hit the range), the user can obtain a high APR - 15 % (Guaranteed APR < APR within the price range).
2) During the observation period, if the price of the target asset moves the upper/lower limit of the price range (that is, knock out the range), the user will obtain a guaranteed return.
Gate.io **Double No-Touch** is a risk-free product that allows users to get the great joy of gaming while earning guaranteed returns. What's more, if they guess the right price range, they get a chance to obtain a high APR of 15%. 
###How do DailySmile products bring you a return?
1) During the observation period, if the price of the target asset stays within the price range (that is, hit the range), the user can obtain a high APR - 6.5% (Guaranteed APR < APR within the price range).
2) During the observation period, if the price of the target asset moves the upper/lower limit of the price range (that is, knock out the range), the user will obtain a guaranteed return.

###How does the Bullish Shark Fin product generate a return on investment?
1) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset always stay within the per-specified price range, users can earn a higher annualized income (the guaranteed yield rate < the final yield rate < the maximum yield rate); At settlement, the closer the prices of the target asset are to the upper limit of the price range, the higher the annual return.
2) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset rose above the upper limit of the price range but didnt fall out of the lower limit of the price range, the user will obtain a medium yield(3%).
3) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset fell lower than the lower limit of the price range but didnt go beyond the upper limit of the price range, the user will obtain the guaranteed yield rate(0.5%).
###How does the Bearish Shark Fin product generate a return on investment?
1) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset always stay within the per-specified price range, users can earn a higher annualized income (the guaranteed yield rate < the final yield rate < the maximum yield rate); At settlement, the closer the prices of the target asset are to the upper limit of the price range, the higher the annual return.
2) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset rose above the upper limit of the price range but didnt fall out of the lower limit of the price range, the user will obtain a medium yield(3%).
3) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset fell lower than the lower limit of the price range but didnt go beyond the upper limit of the price range, the user will obtain the guaranteed yield rate(0.5%).

article_title: Web3 Fantasy Adventures in 3 Minutes Chapter 2: The Birth of Bitcoin and Its Mysterious Creator
article_link: https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/41094
article: ## Introduction
In the previous chapter, Blocky and Gatsby discovered the wonders of the Magic Ledger (blockchain). Today, they will delve into the legend of the City of Trust and uncover the secrets behind the worlds first digital gold coin. Lets continue the journey and step further into the fantastical world of Web3!
## The Story
Ever since discovering the Magic Ledger, Blocky had been fascinated by the history of the City of Trust. One day, while wandering with Gatsby through an ancient library rumored to hold countless tales of the citys legends, they came across a dimly lit corner.
On a dusty shelf sat a book, its cover inscribed with the title: Satoshi Nakamoto: The Birth of Bitcoin.
Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Blocky asked softly.
Gatsby leaned in with a mysterious air. Satoshi Nakamoto is an enigmatic magician. He appeared during the City of Trusts greatest crisis and created the first digital gold coin-Bitcoin.
Digital gold coin? Blockys eyes widened with curiosity. Is it also recorded on the Magic Ledger?
Gatsby nodded. Exactly. Bitcoin was built upon the Magic Ledger. Satoshis creation transformed the entire city.
Gatsby opened the book and began recounting the legendary tale:
### The Chaotic Era
Long ago, the residents of the City of Trust used traditional gold coins for their transactions. However, these coins relied on the citys treasury for safekeeping, and the treasurys records were often prone to errors. Sometimes, the greed of certain treasury sorcerers even led to the loss of residents wealth.
Everyone longed for a more transparent and reliable monetary system, Gatsby explained. That was when Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin.
### The Birth of Bitcoin
Satoshi Nakamoto designed a unique digital gold coin, with every coin recorded on the Magic Ledger and generated through a process called mining.
Mining? Blocky asked, puzzled. What are they digging for?
Gatsby explained, Mining is a way to make the Magic Ledger more secure. Miners use their computational power to solve complex magical puzzles. When they solve a puzzle, they are rewarded with new Bitcoin.
Gatsby pointed to an illustration in the book: miners operating magical devices in a glowing mine. Each time a puzzle was successfully solved, a new Bitcoin was forged and recorded on the Magic Ledger.
Whats even more important, Gatsby continued, is that Satoshis design fixed the total supply of Bitcoin, ensuring it couldnt be endlessly increased by greedy sorcerers.
### The Mysterious Departure
Where is Satoshi Nakamoto now? Blocky asked curiously.
Gatsby shrugged. No one knows. After completing the initial design of Bitcoin, he vanished from sight. He left behind the foundation of Bitcoin and the Magic Ledger, enabling the residents of the City of Trust to continue building their own future.
### The Magical Powers of Bitcoin
Through this lesson, Blocky summarized Bitcoins three main characteristics:
**1. Decentralization: **Bitcoin doesnt rely on banks or central institutions; it is maintained by miners from around the globe.
**2. Scarcity: **Bitcoin has a limited supply of only 21 million coins, ensuring its value isnt diluted.
**3. Anonymity: **Every transaction is recorded on the ledger, but users identities remain anonymous, protecting their privacy.
After hearing the story, Blocky marveled, Satoshi truly was a great magician. His creation not only solved trust issues but also opened up new possibilities for the City of Trust.
**Stay Tuned for the Next Chapter**
Join Blocky and Gatsby as they continue to explore the boundless possibilities of Web3!

**Gate.io Pre-Market PreMint Introduction as follows:
What is Gate.io Pre-market PreMint?**
Pre-market PreMint allows investors to lock USDT to mint PreTokens and place orders in the trading market to earn profits in advance.
**PreMint Feature Highlights**
-Take Profits Early: The seller can sell PreToken at their favorable prices in the trading market without waiting and gain profits earlier.
-Trade Flexibly: The buyer can buy or sell PreToken at their favorable prices or wait for settlement, allowing for more adaptable trading strategies.
**PreMint Feature Rules**
1.The PreMint entry typically becomes available after the pre-market project begins trading. Users can lock USDT through the PreMint entry to mint PreTokens. Once minted, the corresponding PreToken balance will be added to the users account.
2.The PreToken trading market will open after a specific period once the pre-market project begins trading. Users can trade their minted PreTokens in the PreToken trading market, following the same rules as other trading pairs.
3.The PreMint entry and the PreToken trading market close before the pre-market project trading ends. After the market closes, a snapshot of each UIDs PreToken balance is taken and then cleared.
4.Users can mint PreTokens during the pre-market trading period and trade them in the trading market.
5.Users who pre-minted PreTokens need to deposit the corresponding project tokens before the settlement time and ensure there are enough project tokens in their accounts. The system will deduct the project tokens from the account and return the locked USDT to the users account.
6.After settlement, the system will automatically settle PreToken holders based on the snapshot taken before market closure. Users will then receive the real tokens and any penalty collateral from non-settling minting users.

article_title: Gate.io Structured Product Launched: Earn up to 13% APR
article_link: https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/41089
article: As of today, Gate.io listed our daily **Structured Product** for Daily BTC and USDT SharkFin and Daily ETH SharkFin. They are principal protected and offer users a maximum return of 13%. The subscription starts at **10:00 on November 27, 2024 (UTC)**. We welcome you all to participate!

###How do Sharkfin products bring you a return?
During the observation period, if the price of the target asset stays within the per-specified price range, investors can earn a higher annualized return. At settlement, the closer the target asset prices are to the upper limit of the price range, the higher the annual return.
During the observation period, if the price of the target asset has gone beyond the price range, users can obtain a guaranteed return. If, at 4:00 UTC on the settlement day, the price is above or below the per-specified price range, the product will be settled at the minimum annualized rate of return. If the price always stays within the price range, the rate of return will be determined according to where the BTC/USDT/USDT perpetual contract price falls on Gate.io at 4:00 UTC on the settlement day.
###How does the Double No-Touch products bring you a return?
1) During the observation period, if the price of the target asset stays within the price range (that is, hit the range), the user can obtain a high APR - 15 % (Guaranteed APR < APR within the price range).
2) During the observation period, if the price of the target asset moves the upper/lower limit of the price range (that is, knock out the range), the user will obtain a guaranteed return.
Gate.io **Double No-Touch** is a risk-free product that allows users to get the great joy of gaming while earning guaranteed returns. What's more, if they guess the right price range, they get a chance to obtain a high APR of 15%. 
###How do DailySmile products bring you a return?
1) During the observation period, if the price of the target asset stays within the price range (that is, hit the range), the user can obtain a high APR - 6.5% (Guaranteed APR < APR within the price range).
2) During the observation period, if the price of the target asset moves the upper/lower limit of the price range (that is, knock out the range), the user will obtain a guaranteed return.

###How does the Bullish Shark Fin product generate a return on investment?
1) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset always stay within the per-specified price range, users can earn a higher annualized income (the guaranteed yield rate < the final yield rate < the maximum yield rate); At settlement, the closer the prices of the target asset are to the upper limit of the price range, the higher the annual return.
2) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset rose above the upper limit of the price range but didnt fall out of the lower limit of the price range, the user will obtain a medium yield(3%).
3) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset fell lower than the lower limit of the price range but didnt go beyond the upper limit of the price range, the user will obtain the guaranteed yield rate(0.5%).
###How does the Bearish Shark Fin product generate a return on investment?
1) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset always stay within the per-specified price range, users can earn a higher annualized income (the guaranteed yield rate < the final yield rate < the maximum yield rate); At settlement, the closer the prices of the target asset are to the upper limit of the price range, the higher the annual return.
2) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset rose above the upper limit of the price range but didnt fall out of the lower limit of the price range, the user will obtain a medium yield(3%).
3) During the observation period, if the prices of the target asset fell lower than the lower limit of the price range but didnt go beyond the upper limit of the price range, the user will obtain the guaranteed yield rate(0.5%).
