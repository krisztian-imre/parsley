The specific modifications are as follows:///1.Statistical Period///-Statistical Period: Data will be accumulated over the most recent 24 hours, with statistics updated hourly.///2.Request Types (order placement, modification, and cancellation) ///-Statistics Items: All requests, including successful and failed order placements, cancellations, and modifications (e.g., passive order fills, insufficient funds)will be counted.///3.Rate Limit Rules///-Absence of Fills///-Condition: If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with no order fill in the same period.///-Limitation: Order placement rate will be restricted  to 10r/10s for the next hour.///-Fill Ratio Below 1%///-Condition: If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with the fill ratio below 1%.///-Limitation: Order placement rate will be restricted to 20r/10s for the next hour.///4.Unlock Mechanism///-The system will conduct a dynamic assessment of users' trading activities. Upon detecting that a user's strategy has been appropriately adjusted and aligns with our efficiency standards, the imposed restrictions will be lifted.///-Explanation:///-Every hour, the system calculates the fill ratio for the past 24 hours, applying a restriction for at least one hour. If a user is restricted in the current hour as the fill ratio is recalculated hourly, the restriction will be lifted when the fill ratio exceeds the threshold.///### 3.Calculation of Fill Ratio///The Fill Ratio is determined using the following formula:///Fill Ratio = (Trade Volume in USDT)/ (sum of new and modification and cancellation requests)

Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.///If you have any questions, please contact your dedicated account manager, or send an email to institutional@gate.io, or reach out on Telegram to @KA_EMEA, @KA_APAC.

suppose you have a debt of 20 BTC, and the current BTC index price for BTC is 100,000 USD. Then the maintenance margin requirement for this 20 BTC debt would be calculated as follows: 500,000 * 5% + 500,000 * 6% + 1,000,000 * 7% = 125,000 USD.///For more details on the calculation of the tiered borrowing maintenance margin rate, please refer to:///Multi-Currency Margin Mode - About Margin and Terminology///For real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///Borrowing Rate and Loan Cap///For the query openAPI documentation on the real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///list loan margin tiers///This adjustment only affects the Unified Account business operations, and other business operations such as isolated position leverage and pledge lending are not affected by this adjustment.///**Important Reminder!**///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency is lower than the tier corresponding to 10% of that debt size, your account's maintenance margin rate will be increased at the time when the parameters officially take effect, meaning you have obtained a better liquidation price level.///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency exceeds the tier corresponding to 10%, your account's maintenance margin rate will be lowered at the time when the parameters officially take effect. Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.///If you have any questions, please contact your dedicated account manager, or send an email to institutional@gate.io, or reach out on Telegram to @KA_EMEA, @KA_APAC.

gradient-based calculation rule for the new borrowing maintenance margin is as follows:///Taking BTC as an example, suppose you have a debt of 20 BTC, and the current BTC index price for BTC is 100,000 USD. Then the maintenance margin requirement for this 20 BTC debt would be calculated as follows: 500,000 * 5% + 500,000 * 6% + 1,000,000 * 7% = 125,000 USD.///For more details on the calculation of the tiered borrowing maintenance margin rate, please refer to:///Multi-Currency Margin Mode - About Margin and Terminology///For real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///Borrowing Rate and Loan Cap///For the query openAPI documentation on the real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///list loan margin tiers///This adjustment only affects the Unified Account business operations, and other business operations such as isolated position leverage and pledge lending are not affected by this adjustment.///**Important Reminder!**///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency is lower than the tier corresponding to 10% of that debt size, your account's maintenance margin rate will be increased at the time when the parameters officially take effect, meaning you have obtained a better liquidation price level.///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency exceeds the tier corresponding to 10%, your account's maintenance margin rate will be lowered at the time when the parameters officially take effect. Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.///If you have any questions, please contact your dedicated account manager, or send an email to institutional@gate.io, or reach out on Telegram to @KA_EMEA, @KA_APAC.

This program offers fee discounts on both futures and spot taker orders up to 8%. The program will start from 1st Sep 2024 and be valid until 30th Nov 2024.///#### Target Audience///Institutional clients with a cumulative spot or futures taker trading volume exceeding $200 million in any single month since 2024.///#### Key Benefits///• **Taker Fee Discounts:** Achieve significant discounts on taker fees for both spot and futures trading by meeting monthly taker volume requirements.///• **Institutional Loan Benefits:** Enjoy preferential interest rates on institutional loan services.///**Program Mechanics**///• **Tiered Discount Rates:** New participants will be categorized by their historical monthly taker trading volume since 2024.///• **Discount Application:** The Gate Key Account Manager will apply the corresponding discount rate based on the assigned tier upon your request.///• **Monthly Taker Trading Volume Assessment:** Participants' monthly taker trading volume will be evaluated to ensure their eligibility for the program's benefits. Failure to meet the required volume will result in discount tier and taker fee discounts adjustment. For example, if Client X whose futures taker trading volume in Aug is 5 billion, applies Tier3 discount in Sep successfully. Therefore client X will enjoy an 8% off discount in Sep. If his actual futures taker trading volume in Sep is 2 billion, which falls in the taker trading volume range of  Tier1, as result, the Tier1 discount rate (4%) will be applied to clientX in Oct.///**Discount Rate Tier and Criterion **///**Futures**///|  Tier   | Monthly Futures Taker Trading Volume($)  | Taker Discount rate  |///|  ----  | ----  |----  |///| 1  | $1 billion < X < $3 billion | 4% |///| 2  | $3 billion < X < $6 billion | 6% |///| 3  |$6 billion < X<$10 billion*| 8% |///**Spot**///|  Tier   | Monthly Spot Taker Trading Volume($)   |Taker Discount rate  |///|  ----  | ----  |----  |///| 1  | $500 million < X < $1 billion | 4% |///| 2  | $1 billion < X < $3 billion | 6% |///| 3  |$3 billion < X<$5 billion* | 8% |///*Institutions with over $10 billion monthly futures taker trading volume or $5 billion monthly spot taker trading volume, please contact your key account manager or Gate institutional representative.///**Registration Method**///Fill out the///form///or contact your account manager or Gate institutional representative for registration.

Gate.io	Yes	2024-10-08 11:11:52	2024-09-30 08:16:46	https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/39637	Gate Learn	Gate Research Report Release: Monthly Market Review - August 2024	The latest Gate Research: Monthly Market Review-August 2024 report summarizes and analyzes the market trends, major events, on-chain data, security incidents, and funding information from August, offering deep insights into the overall performance of the crypto market and key industry trends.///**Key Takeaways:**///**Crypto Market Overview: **Bitcoin opened at around $66,000 at the beginning of August. On August 5, it dropped to a low of $49,000 before rebounding to $64,000 by the end of the month, and then retracing to $58,000. The overall performance of the top 10 tokens by market cap was generally sluggish, except for TRX, which saw a significant price increase driven by the popularity of meme tokens within its ecosystem. Most major tokens saw negative returns, and market sentiment turned cautious.///**Global Financial Market: **On August 5, global financial markets experienced a Black Monday. The macroeconomic factors contributing to the crash included the Bank of Japan raising interest rates to 0.25%, with the yen depreciating by about 0.65% that day, impacting global stock markets, and weak U.S. employment data, with July job growth falling short of expectations, fueling concerns about an economic recession. The Nikkei Index dropped 12.4% that day, and the TOPIX index triggered circuit breakers, marking the largest decline in eight years. Nasdaq 100 futures fell more than 2%, and the Dollar index dropped to 103.///**Futures Market: **Affected by the global financial markets, on August 5, long positions in BTC contracts across the network saw liquidations totaling $281 million, while short positions faced liquidations of $126 million. Open interest in BTC contracts declined by 7.7% compared to the previous month.///**ETF Performance: **BTC Spot ETF flows fluctuated significantly this month. A large outflow occurred at the beginning, followed by an inflow mid-month. However, the month ended with a net outflow of $144 million. ETH Spot ETFs experienced a net outflow of $20 million, characterized by substantial inflows early in the month, followed by a persistent trend of minor net outflows.///**Blockchain Network Activity: **On August 15, Aptos' daily transactions soared to 326.3 million, dwarfing its average of about 18 million. This surge likely stems from Tapos Game2, where each in-game click triggers an on-chain transaction. On August 5, network fees spiked, possibly due to the crypto market's sharp decline, which spurred increased on-chain activity.///**Security Incidents: **In August, 26 security incidents occurred in the DeFi sector, causing losses of approximately $5.28 million (including disclosed amounts). Account hacks accounted for 60.0% of attacks, followed by contract vulnerabilities at 26.7%, front-end attacks at 6.7%, and malware attacks at 3.3%.///**Fundraising Activities: **In August, 88 projects secured funding, totaling $80 million. Seed-stage projects dominated, representing 51.4% of the rounds, while 31% of projects raised between $1 and 3 million. CeFi and DeFi emerged as the primary sectors for August's funding, attracting $22.35 million and $10.50 million respectively.///**Click here to download the PDF: English**

This collaboration focused on providing much-needed support to the local community and helping to improve the lives of vulnerable street dogs.///Perros Libres has a unique approach to dog rescue. Working in the small Indigenous village of Tzununa, they are the only organization in the area offering a safe haven for stray dogs. Their efforts go beyond basic care, with a strong focus on love, compassion, and rehabilitation. Many of these dogs, once neglected and mistreated, now find themselves in an environment where they can recover, play freely, and ultimately be rehomed to loving families, both locally and internationally.///In this collaboration, Gate Charity and Perros Libres aimed to raise awareness about the importance of volunteerism, inviting visitors and crypto enthusiasts from the Lake Atitlán community to participate. Lake Atitlán, known for its growing crypto-friendly environment, benefits from having a///Bitcoin///ATM and numerous vendors who accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. This thriving community provided an ideal platform for engaging volunteers who are passionate about both Bitcoin and animal welfare.///The weekly events hosted by Perros Libres play a crucial role in supporting the local community and fostering a sense of connection between volunteers and the rescued dogs.

The typhoon brought torrential rains, leading to severe flooding that devastated homes, infrastructure, and agricultural lands. Many villages were submerged, and roads were washed away, leaving thousands displaced and in need of immediate assistance.///In response to the disaster, Gate Charity sent a truck carrying over 500 kilograms of food and instant noodles to support those affected. This aid provided much-needed relief to communities struggling with food shortages, as many residents were left without access to clean water, shelter, or basic necessities.///The flooding had a particularly devastating impact on local farmers, many of whom lost their crops and livestock, which are their primary means of livelihood. With fields destroyed and animals washed away, many families faced an uncertain future. Gate Charitys efforts aimed to ease this burden by ensuring that, at the very least, essential food supplies were provided to help families get through this difficult period.///In addition to providing immediate food relief, Gate Charity collaborated with local authorities to assess further needs and determine how best to support long-term recovery efforts. The charity remains committed to helping these communities rebuild their lives by coordinating additional support for rebuilding infrastructure and restoring access to essential services like clean water.///The aftermath of Typhoon Yagi continues to present significant challenges, but with support from organizations like Gate Charity, the people of Yen Bai can start to rebuild. These efforts are a vital reminder of the importance of solidarity and swift action in times of crisis.

Gate Charity was pleased to be able to offer books to the children living at FENOU ILE and to provide them with resources to help expand their horizons.///The objectives of the Empowering Minds Book Donation Project and Gate Charity's donation to FENOU ILE orphanage specifically are to provide orphaned children with access to diverse literary resources and to stimulate intellectual curiosity and a passion for learning. The project also aims to:///- Foster creativity, critical thinking, and imagination.///- Enhance educational opportunities and academic performance and///- Promote emotional well-being and personal development.///Books can be transformative to children who may not have the educational support systems to help them excel. They can serve as educational tools and help stimulate cognitive functions and sharpen problem solving skills. Books can also provide a sense of comfort and hope and help children learn from stories that take them to environments beyond their immediate surroundings. Reading can also introduce children to different cultures and perspectives that they may not have immediate access to otherwise. Finally, books can help children gain access to future opportunities like higher education and can inspire them to develop personal goals and aspirations.///The Empowering Minds Book Donation Project was created to provide orphaned children with the gift of knowledge and empowerment and to inspire them to achieve their dreams.

The event was specifically focused on celebrating the 79th Independence Day of Indonesia.///Participants played an important role in the festival, completing several main events to commemorate Indonesia's Independence. The flag ceremony, which took place on the second day of the festival, was one of the highlights of the celebration and was attended by children, parents, and Suku Anak Dalam's community leaders. The flag ceremony symbolized the unity and spirit of struggle that is still present in the community today. It reflected feelings and thoughts of patriotism in the hearts and minds of community members and instilled memories of the sacrifices made by previous generations so that Indonesia could be independent.///The festival also included a series of Independence Day Competitions that made the 79th Independence Day particularly memorable for members of the Suku Anak Dalam community. The competitions were included to strengthen the connection between members of the community. Each of the competitions required teamwork and offered entertainment to those participating and to everyone watching as well. Important values like sportsmanship and cooperation were taught to younger participants through these competitive events. Events included sack races, cracker-eating contests, tug-of-war, and other similar competitive activities.///The final main event of the festival was the Carnival/Parade. The theme of the carnival was the Spirit of National Heroes' Struggle. Participants wore costumes and traditional clothing that reflected the culture of the Suku Anak Dalam community which were combined with elements that fit the theme of overcoming the national struggle for independence. The carnival showcased the culture while highlighting the sacrifices made by some of Indonesia's most significant heroes. The carnival involved the youth who participated via art and cultural performances. Youth communities in Jambi participated and the local government whole-heartedly supported the event. Ultimately, participants were left with feelings of pride for their community and their country, and lessons were taught by the older generations to the younger ones. ///#### About Sobat Eksplorasi Anak Dalam (SEAD) Jambi and Suku Anak Dalam (SAD)///Sobat Eksplorasi Anak Dalam (SEAD) Jambi is a Non-Profit Organization engaging with educational inequality and social issues. The main goal of this organization is to eradicate the illiteracy of the Anak Dalam Tribe (SAD).  SAD is one of the oldest ethnic minorities in Indonesia. They live and make a living relying on the wealth of the forest with very strong customs. Unfortunately, at this time, their lives are starting to be disturbed, and they are experiencing various difficulties due to the development of modernization, which has taken away their forest rights. Therefore, literacy education is one of the basic keys they must have to protect themselves from being exploited. Besides, this organization is also a forum for Jambi's youth (volunteers) willing to help locals contribute to their regions and raise awareness of the intended issues. The significant impact achieved has not only eradicated SAD illiteracy, but we have also opened access to formal and informal education for them. ///Website: https://seadjambi.com////Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sead_jambi////**Blockchain Access to Change Lives**///Build a world where everyone can access financial services and help via blockchain solutions whenever and wherever needed.///Gate Charity Twitter: https://twitter.com/gatecharity///Gate Charity///August 28th, 2024

Through interactive workshops and case studies, the participants were able to apply their learning in real-world scenarios, gaining confidence to take the first steps toward launching their own businesses or exploring career opportunities in the international trade sector.///Gate Charitys commitment to empowering the next generation was evident throughout the program, which aimed to address the challenges of youth unemployment in Africa by equipping participants with practical skills for self-sustainability. By offering this training, Gate Charity reinforced its dedication to economic inclusion and its belief in the power of knowledge as a tool for creating positive change.///As the young participants move forward with their newfound expertise, this program is expected to inspire business creation and provide opportunities in the fast-growing trade sector, helping to build a brighter future for Africas youth.

The goal of the event was to raise public awareness about the negative impacts of using animals in educational and research settings, while also highlighting effective alternative methodologies that are already available. The days program included an exhibition featuring thought-provoking images and objects, as well as a seminar led by renowned experts in the field.///The event brought attention to the fact that after food production, animal experimentation is the human activity that exploits animals the most. In Brazil alone, approximately 3 million animals are subjected to research protocols each year before being killed. The seminar focused on the urgency of replacing these harmful practices with ethical alternatives, encouraging a shift toward more humane methods.///With over 100 attendees, including activists and concerned citizens, the event sparked meaningful conversations about reducing the number of animals used in research and teaching. Gate Charitys presence was prominent throughout the event, with its support displayed through banners, digital presentations, and mentions on social media platforms. The collaboration with Fórum Animal strengthened the message of advocating for change and ensuring that animals are no longer subjected to exploitation in these fields.///Fórum Animal, a non-profit organization focused on animal welfare and veganism, continues to play a crucial role in driving forward the movement for ethical alternatives in teaching and research. This event was a significant step toward facilitating broader initiatives to protect animals and promote more compassionate practices for the future.///**Blockchain Access to Change Lives**///Build a world where everyone can access financial services and help via blockchain solutions whenever and wherever needed.///Gate Charity Twitter: https://twitter.com/gatecharity///Gate Charity///September 27th, 2024

With this new change, merchants can choose the reference price based on their needs and maximum the profits.///**Two reference prices:**///1. Platform Reference Price: Calculated by weighting the P2P order books of multiple exchanges.///2. Spot Reference Price: Obtained from exchange rate data from multiple central banks worldwide.///***Reminder: If you are using Gate APP, please make sure to update your APP version to the latest to see this change. ***///**How to switch the reference price?**///1. Go to P2P and post an advertisement///2. Select [Float price] and click on the switch icon beside [Platform Reference Price]///3. Choose the reference price you prefer and follow the next steps to finish posting the ad///**Frequently Asked Questions:**///1. What are Fixed Price advertisements?///The price of fixed-price ads is fixed and does not move with the crypto market price.///2. What are Floating Price Advertisements?///The price of floating-price ads fluctuates with the market and is refreshed every 5 minutes.///3. What is the Floating Percentage?///The Floating Percentage is the premium the ad publisher charges to calculate the price they would like to buy/sell their assets.///4. Can you provide an example to show the difference between fixed price and float price?///- Fixed price includes the price of the Fiat currency you choose and the profit you want to earn. For example, if you plan to trade the RUB/USDT trading pair and the reference price of RUB is 72, and you would like to earn 5% profit (3.6), you would set up a fixed price of 75.6.///- On the other hand, the floating price will fluctuate with the reference price, with pricing that refreshes every 5 minutes.  For example, if you want to buy the asset at a lower price, you can set up an ad with a floating price margin of 10% (pricing formula: 72 x 90% = 63).///**The highest floating percentage you can set is 20%.*///------------
