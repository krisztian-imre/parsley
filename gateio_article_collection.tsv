To encourage more institutions to participate in the event and provide more liquidity to the market, we plan to optimize the assessment rules of the event. Effective date: 00:00, October 10, 2024 (UTC+8).///Know more about GMMC: ///https://www.gate.io/global-market-maker-program///### The rules are adjusted as follows:///**The original pending order rule:**  For each trading market, both the ask and bid sides must simultaneously meet the depth requirement in each minute snapshot for the target to be met.///**Change the pending order rule:** If the depth of any side of the snapshot of each trading market per minute meets the requirement, the target is reached.///To streamline the October assessment, the evaluation will be divided into two phases: from October 1 to October 9, the original rules will apply, and from October 10 onward, the new rules will apply. The scores from both phases will be combined to determine the total GMMC score.///The details are as follows:///October 1st - October 9th (according to the following rules, the original rules)///After October 10 (according to the following rules)

The specific modifications are as follows:///1.Statistical Period///-Statistical Period: Data will be accumulated over the most recent 24 hours, with statistics updated hourly.///2.Request Types (order placement, modification, and cancellation) ///-Statistics Items: All requests, including successful and failed order placements, cancellations, and modifications (e.g., passive order fills, insufficient funds)will be counted.///3.Rate Limit Rules///-Absence of Fills///-Condition: If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with no order fill in the same period.///-Limitation: Order placement rate will be restricted  to 10r/10s for the next hour.///-Fill Ratio Below 1%///-Condition: If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with the fill ratio below 1%.///-Limitation: Order placement rate will be restricted to 20r/10s for the next hour.///4.Unlock Mechanism///-The system will conduct a dynamic assessment of users' trading activities. Upon detecting that a user's strategy has been appropriately adjusted and aligns with our efficiency standards, the imposed restrictions will be lifted.///-Explanation:///-Every hour, the system calculates the fill ratio for the past 24 hours, applying a restriction for at least one hour. If a user is restricted in the current hour as the fill ratio is recalculated hourly, the restriction will be lifted when the fill ratio exceeds the threshold.///### 3.Calculation of Fill Ratio///The Fill Ratio is determined using the following formula:///Fill Ratio = (Trade Volume in USDT)/ (sum of new and modification and cancellation requests)

suppose you have a debt of 20 BTC, and the current BTC index price for BTC is 100,000 USD. Then the maintenance margin requirement for this 20 BTC debt would be calculated as follows: 500,000 * 5% + 500,000 * 6% + 1,000,000 * 7% = 125,000 USD.///For more details on the calculation of the tiered borrowing maintenance margin rate, please refer to:///Multi-Currency Margin Mode - About Margin and Terminology///For real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///Borrowing Rate and Loan Cap///For the query openAPI documentation on the real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///list loan margin tiers///This adjustment only affects the Unified Account business operations, and other business operations such as isolated position leverage and pledge lending are not affected by this adjustment.///**Important Reminder!**///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency is lower than the tier corresponding to 10% of that debt size, your account's maintenance margin rate will be increased at the time when the parameters officially take effect, meaning you have obtained a better liquidation price level.///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency exceeds the tier corresponding to 10%, your account's maintenance margin rate will be lowered at the time when the parameters officially take effect. Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.///If you have any questions, please contact your dedicated account manager, or send an email to institutional@gate.io, or reach out on Telegram to @KA_EMEA, @KA_APAC.

gradient-based calculation rule for the new borrowing maintenance margin is as follows:///Taking BTC as an example, suppose you have a debt of 20 BTC, and the current BTC index price for BTC is 100,000 USD. Then the maintenance margin requirement for this 20 BTC debt would be calculated as follows: 500,000 * 5% + 500,000 * 6% + 1,000,000 * 7% = 125,000 USD.///For more details on the calculation of the tiered borrowing maintenance margin rate, please refer to:///Multi-Currency Margin Mode - About Margin and Terminology///For real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///Borrowing Rate and Loan Cap///For the query openAPI documentation on the real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///list loan margin tiers///This adjustment only affects the Unified Account business operations, and other business operations such as isolated position leverage and pledge lending are not affected by this adjustment.///**Important Reminder!**///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency is lower than the tier corresponding to 10% of that debt size, your account's maintenance margin rate will be increased at the time when the parameters officially take effect, meaning you have obtained a better liquidation price level.///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency exceeds the tier corresponding to 10%, your account's maintenance margin rate will be lowered at the time when the parameters officially take effect. Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.///If you have any questions, please contact your dedicated account manager, or send an email to institutional@gate.io, or reach out on Telegram to @KA_EMEA, @KA_APAC.

This program offers fee discounts on both futures and spot taker orders up to 8%. The program will start from 1st Sep 2024 and be valid until 30th Nov 2024.///#### Target Audience///Institutional clients with a cumulative spot or futures taker trading volume exceeding $200 million in any single month since 2024.///#### Key Benefits///• **Taker Fee Discounts:** Achieve significant discounts on taker fees for both spot and futures trading by meeting monthly taker volume requirements.///• **Institutional Loan Benefits:** Enjoy preferential interest rates on institutional loan services.///**Program Mechanics**///• **Tiered Discount Rates:** New participants will be categorized by their historical monthly taker trading volume since 2024.///• **Discount Application:** The Gate Key Account Manager will apply the corresponding discount rate based on the assigned tier upon your request.///• **Monthly Taker Trading Volume Assessment:** Participants' monthly taker trading volume will be evaluated to ensure their eligibility for the program's benefits. Failure to meet the required volume will result in discount tier and taker fee discounts adjustment. For example, if Client X whose futures taker trading volume in Aug is 5 billion, applies Tier3 discount in Sep successfully. Therefore client X will enjoy an 8% off discount in Sep. If his actual futures taker trading volume in Sep is 2 billion, which falls in the taker trading volume range of  Tier1, as result, the Tier1 discount rate (4%) will be applied to clientX in Oct.///**Discount Rate Tier and Criterion **///**Futures**///|  Tier   | Monthly Futures Taker Trading Volume($)  | Taker Discount rate  |///|  ----  | ----  |----  |///| 1  | $1 billion < X < $3 billion | 4% |///| 2  | $3 billion < X < $6 billion | 6% |///| 3  |$6 billion < X<$10 billion*| 8% |///**Spot**///|  Tier   | Monthly Spot Taker Trading Volume($)   |Taker Discount rate  |///|  ----  | ----  |----  |///| 1  | $500 million < X < $1 billion | 4% |///| 2  | $1 billion < X < $3 billion | 6% |///| 3  |$3 billion < X<$5 billion* | 8% |///*Institutions with over $10 billion monthly futures taker trading volume or $5 billion monthly spot taker trading volume, please contact your key account manager or Gate institutional representative.///**Registration Method**///Fill out the///form///or contact your account manager or Gate institutional representative for registration.

This report provides in-depth insights into the overall performance of the crypto market and key industry trends.///**Key Takeaways:**///1. **Crypto Market Overview: **After an initial 11% correction at the beginning of the month, Bitcoin (BTC) quickly recovered and entered an upward trend. It rebounded from its lowest point to reach a high of $66,512, marking a 26% increase. Ethereum (ETH) followed a similar pattern, dropping 14% at the start of the month before entering a period of consolidation. On September 19, ETH broke through resistance and touched a high of $2,728.///1. **Global Financial Markets: **On September 19, the Federal Reserve announced a 50 basis point cut in the benchmark interest rate to 4.75%-5.00%. As interest rates decrease, returns on fixed-income assets are expected to decline, potentially shifting investors' focus towards higher-risk (and higher-return) assets. Crypto assets, being a type of risk asset, may benefit from this shift.///1. **Futures Market: **Unlike the previous month, September didn't see any instances of massive single-day liquidations in BTC contracts. The overall open interest showed an upward trend, suggesting that market participants were more inclined to hold contract positions in an environment of relatively reduced volatility. Funding rates for BTC and ETH positions were mostly positive, with rates gradually increasing in late September. This indicates strengthening bullish sentiment, higher demand for long positions, and optimism among some investors regarding current prices.///1. **ETF Performance: **Bitcoin spot ETFs experienced outflows for the first four trading days of the month, but this trend reversed to inflows, with the scale of inflows gradually expanding. On September 27, the single-day net inflow reached a monthly high of $494 million. The month saw a total net inflow of $1.26 billion. In contrast, Ethereum spot ETFs saw net outflows on most trading days, totaling $47 million for the month.///1. **Blockchain Network Activity: **Overall transaction numbers remained stable in September. Solana continued to lead in daily transactions, with an average of 36 million per day, accounting for 41.68% of total transactions across popular chains. Its peak daily transactions reached 40.4 million. Ethereum's daily accumulated Gas Fee peaked at $8.2 million in September, representing 48.41% of fees across popular chains.///1. **Fundraising Information: **A total of 98 projects completed funding rounds this month, with 64 projects disclosing specific funding amounts and rounds. The cumulative funding amount reached $600 million. Overall, infrastructure and DeFi were the main areas of investment in September, with funding amounts of $283 million and $178 million, respectively.///1. **Security Incidents: **In September, the Web3 sector experienced 28 security incidents, resulting in losses exceeding $94.24 million (including disclosed amounts). Account hacks accounted for 37% of these incidents, while attacks due to contract vulnerabilities made up 25.9%.///**Click here to download the PDF: English**///**Gate Research**///Gate Research is a comprehensive blockchain and cryptocurrency research platform that delivers in-depth content.

Participants wore costumes and traditional clothing that reflected the culture of the Suku Anak Dalam community which were combined with elements that fit the theme of overcoming the national struggle for independence. The carnival showcased the culture while highlighting the sacrifices made by some of Indonesia's most significant heroes. The carnival involved the youth who participated via art and cultural performances. Youth communities in Jambi participated and the local government whole-heartedly supported the event. Ultimately, participants were left with feelings of pride for their community and their country, and lessons were taught by the older generations to the younger ones. ///#### About Sobat Eksplorasi Anak Dalam (SEAD) Jambi and Suku Anak Dalam (SAD)///Sobat Eksplorasi Anak Dalam (SEAD) Jambi is a Non-Profit Organization engaging with educational inequality and social issues. The main goal of this organization is to eradicate the illiteracy of the Anak Dalam Tribe (SAD).  SAD is one of the oldest ethnic minorities in Indonesia. They live and make a living relying on the wealth of the forest with very strong customs. Unfortunately, at this time, their lives are starting to be disturbed, and they are experiencing various difficulties due to the development of modernization, which has taken away their forest rights. Therefore, literacy education is one of the basic keys they must have to protect themselves from being exploited. Besides, this organization is also a forum for Jambi's youth (volunteers) willing to help locals contribute to their regions and raise awareness of the intended issues. The significant impact achieved has not only eradicated SAD illiteracy, but we have also opened access to formal and informal education for them. ///Website: https://seadjambi.com////Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sead_jambi////**Blockchain Access to Change Lives**///Build a world where everyone can access financial services and help via blockchain solutions whenever and wherever needed.///Gate Charity Twitter: https://twitter.com/gatecharity///Gate Charity///August 28th, 2024

With this new change, merchants can choose the reference price based on their needs and maximum the profits.///**Two reference prices:**///1. Platform Reference Price: Calculated by weighting the P2P order books of multiple exchanges.///2. Spot Reference Price: Obtained from exchange rate data from multiple central banks worldwide.///***Reminder: If you are using Gate APP, please make sure to update your APP version to the latest to see this change. ***///**How to switch the reference price?**///1. Go to P2P and post an advertisement///2. Select [Float price] and click on the switch icon beside [Platform Reference Price]///3. Choose the reference price you prefer and follow the next steps to finish posting the ad///**Frequently Asked Questions:**///1. What are Fixed Price advertisements?///The price of fixed-price ads is fixed and does not move with the crypto market price.///2. What are Floating Price Advertisements?///The price of floating-price ads fluctuates with the market and is refreshed every 5 minutes.///3. What is the Floating Percentage?///The Floating Percentage is the premium the ad publisher charges to calculate the price they would like to buy/sell their assets.///4. Can you provide an example to show the difference between fixed price and float price?///- Fixed price includes the price of the Fiat currency you choose and the profit you want to earn. For example, if you plan to trade the RUB/USDT trading pair and the reference price of RUB is 72, and you would like to earn 5% profit (3.6), you would set up a fixed price of 75.6.///- On the other hand, the floating price will fluctuate with the reference price, with pricing that refreshes every 5 minutes.  For example, if you want to buy the asset at a lower price, you can set up an ad with a floating price margin of 10% (pricing formula: 72 x 90% = 63).///**The highest floating percentage you can set is 20%.*///------------

Gate.io	Yes	2024-10-16 19:10:22 UTC	2024-10-16 02:55:57 UTC	https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/39924	Announcements	Gate.io APP Contract Now Supports Trailing Stop Order - Helping You Manage Trades Intelligently	The Gate.io APP now officially supports the trailing order feature, providing users with a more intelligent and flexible tool for managing trading strategies. This feature helps users automatically adjust orders during market fluctuations, enhancing trading efficiency and optimizing profit and risk control.///### What is a Trailing Order?///A trailing order is a strategic order that tracks the market price, allowing users to preset orders within a specific percentage or price range from the market price. When the market reverses (pulls back), the trailing order will place the pre-set order in the market.///As the price moves in a favorable direction, the trailing order will move along with it. As long as the price continues to move in favor of the trader, the trigger price will adjust accordingly, ensuring that users lock in profits while continuing to gain in favorable conditions.///Conversely, if the price moves against the trade by a certain percentage, the trailing order allows users to preset a market order to reduce or close their position. This helps users limit losses and protect profits in unfavorable conditions.///Note: A trailing order does not move in the opposite direction.///### Core Features///**1. Callback Setting:**///Users can set the callback percentage or fixed price distance. When the price moves in a favorable direction, the trigger price adjusts accordingly. When the price pulls back by the set percentage, the system automatically submits a market order.///**2. Activation Price Setting:**///Users can choose to set an activation price, which will trigger the trailing order only when the market price reaches this activation price. If no activation price is set, the order becomes effective immediately.///For detailed instructions, please refer to the guide on How to Set Trailing Stop Orders.///### Applicable Scenarios///**1. Automatically Lock in Profits:**///When the position price continues to rise, a trailing order can help users automatically lock in profits and avoid missing the optimal closing opportunity due to market pullbacks.///**2. Effectively Limit Losses:**///In case of unfavorable market movements, a trailing order can help users automatically submit a closing or reducing order to stop losses in time and protect account funds.///**3. Capture Market Trends:**///For users looking to seize market reversal opportunities, a trailing order can automatically execute trades based on set conditions, reducing the need for manual adjustments and increasing trading efficiency.///### Example Operations///**1. Long Position:**///A user holds a long position of 1 BTC with an entry price of 50,000 USDT and expects a 5% market pullback as the optimal closing opportunity. The user can set a trailing order activation price at 52,000 USDT with a 5% callback. When the market price rises to 52,000 USDT and then pulls back 5% to 49,400 USDT, the system will automatically execute a market order to close the position.///**2. Short Position:**///A user holds a short position of 1 BTC with an entry price of 50,000 USDT and expects a 5% rebound as the optimal closing opportunity. The user sets a trailing order activation price at 48,000 USDT with a 5% callback. When the market price drops to 48,000 USDT and then rebounds 5% to 50,400 USDT, the system will automatically execute a market order to close the position.///### Important Notes///**1. **Before a trailing order is successfully triggered, the system will not freeze the margin or positions, so be cautious to avoid the margin or position being occupied by limit orders or ordinary stop-loss orders.///**2. **The triggering of a trailing order is not guaranteed to succeed and may fail due to position limits, insufficient margin, or the contract being in a non-trading state. The market orders triggered will be handled as ordinary market orders (IOC type) and may not fully execute. Unfilled or partially filled orders will be displayed in [Order History] - [Limit | Market Orders].///**3. **After the trailing order is filled, it will close the corresponding position or open a new position according to the users order quantity. If the order fails, the original position and margin will remain unchanged.///**4. **The maximum quantity per trailing order varies for different contracts and will be dynamically adjusted according to market conditions.///Gate.io reserves the final interpretation of this product.///For further assistance, please visit the official Gate.io support page or contact the Gate.io customer service team.

Giovanni Cunti, CEO of Gate.MT, an entity within the Gate Group, highlighted the growing institutional interest in Web3, emphasizing that MiCA's introduction will provide the regulatory clarity needed to foster innovation and stability across Europe's digital asset market.///The enthusiasm for Web3 is growing rapidly, Cunti remarked. At the convention, it was clear that new institutional players are eyeing the market, and MiCA will be the catalyst for their involvement.///Web3 is gaining significant momentum across Europe, driven by MiCA's promise of a clear regulatory framework. The new rules are expected to make Europe a more attractive environment for digital asset innovation, encouraging both new entrants and increased market activity from established players.///The new regulation will bring much-needed stability to the European market, attracting fresh participants and boosting activity among existing ones, Cunti added.///As announced in September, the Malta-based Gate.MT is preparing to expand its operations across the entire European Economic Area once MiCA takes effect, with Malta serving as the central hub for Gate Group's European activities.///Gate.MT is positioned to be one of the first to seize the opportunities created by MiCA, said Cunti. Our team is fully focused on completing the final steps to secure a MiCA license by early 2025.///*Gate Technology Ltd (Gate.MT) is a company incorporated in Malta with registration number C89337 and trading under the name 'Gate.MT'.
