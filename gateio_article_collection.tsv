Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.///If you have any questions, please contact your dedicated account manager, or send an email to institutional@gate.io, or reach out on Telegram to @KA_EMEA, @KA_APAC.

To encourage more institutions to participate in the event and provide more liquidity to the market, we plan to optimize the assessment rules of the event. Effective date: 00:00, October 10, 2024 (UTC+8).///Know more about GMMC: ///https://www.gate.io/global-market-maker-program///### The rules are adjusted as follows:///**The original pending order rule:**  For each trading market, both the ask and bid sides must simultaneously meet the depth requirement in each minute snapshot for the target to be met.///**Change the pending order rule:** If the depth of any side of the snapshot of each trading market per minute meets the requirement, the target is reached.///To streamline the October assessment, the evaluation will be divided into two phases: from October 1 to October 9, the original rules will apply, and from October 10 onward, the new rules will apply. The scores from both phases will be combined to determine the total GMMC score.///The details are as follows:///October 1st - October 9th (according to the following rules, the original rules)///After October 10 (according to the following rules)

The specific modifications are as follows:///1.Statistical Period///-Statistical Period: Data will be accumulated over the most recent 24 hours, with statistics updated hourly.///2.Request Types (order placement, modification, and cancellation) ///-Statistics Items: All requests, including successful and failed order placements, cancellations, and modifications (e.g., passive order fills, insufficient funds)will be counted.///3.Rate Limit Rules///-Absence of Fills///-Condition: If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with no order fill in the same period.///-Limitation: Order placement rate will be restricted  to 10r/10s for the next hour.///-Fill Ratio Below 1%///-Condition: If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with the fill ratio below 1%.///-Limitation: Order placement rate will be restricted to 20r/10s for the next hour.///4.Unlock Mechanism///-The system will conduct a dynamic assessment of users' trading activities. Upon detecting that a user's strategy has been appropriately adjusted and aligns with our efficiency standards, the imposed restrictions will be lifted.///-Explanation:///-Every hour, the system calculates the fill ratio for the past 24 hours, applying a restriction for at least one hour. If a user is restricted in the current hour as the fill ratio is recalculated hourly, the restriction will be lifted when the fill ratio exceeds the threshold.///### 3.Calculation of Fill Ratio///The Fill Ratio is determined using the following formula:///Fill Ratio = (Trade Volume in USDT)/ (sum of new and modification and cancellation requests)

suppose you have a debt of 20 BTC, and the current BTC index price for BTC is 100,000 USD. Then the maintenance margin requirement for this 20 BTC debt would be calculated as follows: 500,000 * 5% + 500,000 * 6% + 1,000,000 * % = 125,000 USD.///For more details on the calculation of the tiered borrowing maintenance margin rate, please refer to:///Multi-Currency Margin Mode - About Margin and Terminology///For real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///Borrowing Rate and Loan Cap///For the query openAPI documentation on the real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///list loan margin tiers///This adjustment only affects the Unified Account business operations, and other business operations such as isolated position leverage and pledge lending are not affected by this adjustment.///**Important Reminder!**///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency is lower than the tier corresponding to 10% of that debt size, your account's maintenance margin rate will be increased at the time when the parameters officially take effect, meaning you have obtained a better liquidation price level.///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency exceeds the tier corresponding to 10%, your account's maintenance margin rate will be lowered at the time when the parameters officially take effect. Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.///If you have any questions, please contact your dedicated account manager, or send an email to institutional@gate.io, or reach out on Telegram to @KA_EMEA, @KA_APAC.

gradient-based calculation rule for the new borrowing maintenance margin is as follows:///Taking BTC as an example, suppose you have a debt of 20 BTC, and the current BTC index price for BTC is 100,000 USD. Then the maintenance margin requirement for this 20 BTC debt would be calculated as follows: 500,000 * 5% + 500,000 * 6% + 1,000,000 * % = 125,000 USD.///For more details on the calculation of the tiered borrowing maintenance margin rate, please refer to:///Multi-Currency Margin Mode - About Margin and Terminology///For real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///Borrowing Rate and Loan Cap///For the query openAPI documentation on the real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:///list loan margin tiers///This adjustment only affects the Unified Account business operations, and other business operations such as isolated position leverage and pledge lending are not affected by this adjustment.///**Important Reminder!**///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency is lower than the tier corresponding to 10% of that debt size, your account's maintenance margin rate will be increased at the time when the parameters officially take effect, meaning you have obtained a better liquidation price level.///If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency exceeds the tier corresponding to 10%, your account's maintenance margin rate will be lowered at the time when the parameters officially take effect. Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.///If you have any questions, please contact your dedicated account manager, or send an email to institutional@gate.io, or reach out on Telegram to @KA_EMEA, @KA_APAC.

Waste management has been a growing issue in Indonesias urban areas, with the waste pickers of Kampung Pemulung among the most affected, facing challenges related to education, health, and social stigma.///RKPS Jambi, an organization driven by young individuals passionate about social change, initiated this project to empower the Kampung Pemulung community.

In addition to educational support, it addressed health needs by organizing check-ups, promoting cleanliness, and educating the community on health practices.///Environmental awareness was another key aspect of the initiative. By teaching proper waste management practices and encouraging recycling activities, the program aimed to foster a more sustainable environment. Economic empowerment was also at the core of this project, as it involved marketing recycled products made by waste pickers and offering entrepreneurship training to help improve their economic welfare.///The initiative successfully raised awareness about environmental cleanliness and empowered waste pickers to participate in waste management activities. Through skills development and economic support, it opened up new opportunities for waste pickers and their families, ultimately enhancing their quality of life and welfare.///Gate Charity and RKPS Jambi hope that this program will not only contribute to the lasting betterment of Kampung Pemulung but also inspire other young people to engage in social activities and become agents of change in their communities.///**Blockchain Access to Change Lives**///Build a world where everyone can access financial services and help via blockchain solutions whenever and wherever needed.///Gate Charity Twitter: https://twitter.com/gatecharity///Gate Charity///October 8th, 2024

The flag ceremony, which took place on the second day of the festival, was one of the highlights of the celebration and was attended by children, parents, and Suku Anak Dalam's community leaders. The flag ceremony symbolized the unity and spirit of struggle that is still present in the community today. It reflected feelings and thoughts of patriotism in the hearts and minds of community members and instilled memories of the sacrifices made by previous generations so that Indonesia could be independent.///The festival also included a series of Independence Day Competitions that made the 9th Independence Day particularly memorable for members of the Suku Anak Dalam community.

They live and make a living relying on the wealth of the forest with very strong customs. Unfortunately, at this time, their lives are starting to be disturbed, and they are experiencing various difficulties due to the development of modernization, which has taken away their forest rights. Therefore, literacy education is one of the basic keys they must have to protect themselves from being exploited. Besides, this organization is also a forum for Jambi's youth (volunteers) willing to help locals contribute to their regions and raise awareness of the intended issues. The significant impact achieved has not only eradicated SAD illiteracy, but we have also opened access to formal and informal education for them. ///Website: https://seadjambi.com////Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sead_jambi////**Blockchain Access to Change Lives**///Build a world where everyone can access financial services and help via blockchain solutions whenever and wherever needed.///Gate Charity Twitter: https://twitter.com/gatecharity///Gate Charity///August 28th, 2024

By optimizing the fund management, the cost and risks for you to get leveraged exposure are significantly reduced.///Risk Warning///Digital currency prices are susceptible to high volatility, which is even more tangible for the leveraged ETF products. Therefore there is a risk to suffer amplified loss. Please fully understand the product and risks involved before trading. Furthermore, the change of an ETF product is not always about the target times of the underlying asset over a certain time span as the result of scheduled or irregular re-balancing.///An ETF product is hedged in a perpetual contract market, the profit willexpand the position and the loss will decrease the position, which will incur greater friction in a swinging market. Due to the rebalancing mechanism and the holding cost, the ETF is not suitable for long term holding. It has greater fluctuation and higher risk.

With this new change, merchants can choose the reference price based on their needs and maximum the profits.///**Two reference prices:**///1. Platform Reference Price: Calculated by weighting the P2P order books of multiple exchanges.///2. Spot Reference Price: Obtained from exchange rate data from multiple central banks worldwide.///***Reminder: If you are using Gate APP, please make sure to update your APP version to the latest to see this change. ***///**How to switch the reference price?**///1. Go to P2P and post an advertisement///2. Select [Float price] and click on the switch icon beside [Platform Reference Price]///3. Choose the reference price you prefer and follow the next steps to finish posting the ad///**Frequently Asked Questions:**///1. What are Fixed Price advertisements?///The price of fixed-price ads is fixed and does not move with the crypto market price.///2. What are Floating Price Advertisements?///The price of floating-price ads fluctuates with the market and is refreshed every 5 minutes.///3. What is the Floating Percentage?///The Floating Percentage is the premium the ad publisher charges to calculate the price they would like to buy/sell their assets.///4. Can you provide an example to show the difference between fixed price and float price?///- Fixed price includes the price of the Fiat currency you choose and the profit you want to earn. For example, if you plan to trade the RUB/USDT trading pair and the reference price of RUB is 2, and you would like to earn 5% profit (3.6), you would set up a fixed price of 5.6.///- On the other hand, the floating price will fluctuate with the reference price, with pricing that refreshes every 5 minutes.  For example, if you want to buy the asset at a lower price, you can set up an ad with a floating price margin of 10% (pricing formula: 2 x 90% = 63).///**The highest floating percentage you can set is 20%.*///------------
