Gate.io	https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/39147	Institutional & VIP	Gate.io Unified Account to Launch the Fourth Batch of Tiered Borrowing Maintenance Margin Rate on September 12th	"

Dear Gate.io Users,

To strengthen the overall risk control of the Unified Account and to provide users with smaller capital volumes a better liquidation price level, reducing the risk of liquidation, Gate.io will officially launch the Fourth Batch of Tiered Borrowing Maintenance Margin Rate on September 12th (see the table below for  new maintenance margin rate requirements). Other currencies will continue to maintain their original single-tier borrowing maintenance margin rate requirements, with adjustments to be made in batches later.

The new gradient-based calculation rule for the new borrowing maintenance margin is as follows:
Taking BTC as an example, suppose you have a debt of 20 BTC, and the current BTC index price for BTC is 100,000 USD. Then the maintenance margin requirement for this 20 BTC debt would be calculated as follows: 500,000 * 5% + 500,000 * 6% + 1,000,000 * 7% = 125,000 USD.

For more details on the calculation of the tiered borrowing maintenance margin rate, please refer to:
Multi-Currency Margin Mode - About Margin and Terminology
For real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:
Borrowing Rate and Loan Cap
For the query openAPI documentation on the real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:
list loan margin tiers
This adjustment only affects the Unified Account business operations, and other business operations such as isolated position leverage and pledge lending are not affected by this adjustment.

**Important Reminder!**
If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency is lower than the tier corresponding to 10% of that debt size, your account's maintenance margin rate will be increased at the time when the parameters officially take effect, meaning you have obtained a better liquidation price level.

If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency exceeds the tier corresponding to 10%, your account's maintenance margin rate will be lowered at the time when the parameters officially take effect. Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.

The new gradient-based calculation rule for the new borrowing maintenance margin is as follows:
Taking BTC as an example, suppose you have a debt of 20 BTC, and the current BTC index price for BTC is 100,000 USD. Then the maintenance margin requirement for this 20 BTC debt would be calculated as follows: 500,000 * 5% + 500,000 * 6% + 1,000,000 * 7% = 125,000 USD.

For more details on the calculation of the tiered borrowing maintenance margin rate, please refer to:
Multi-Currency Margin Mode - About Margin and Terminology
For real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:
Borrowing Rate and Loan Cap
For the query openAPI documentation on the real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:
list loan margin tiers
This adjustment only affects the Unified Account business operations, and other business operations such as isolated position leverage and pledge lending are not affected by this adjustment.

**Important Reminder!**
If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency is lower than the tier corresponding to 10% of that debt size, your account's maintenance margin rate will be increased at the time when the parameters officially take effect, meaning you have obtained a better liquidation price level.

If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency exceeds the tier corresponding to 10%, your account's maintenance margin rate will be lowered at the time when the parameters officially take effect. Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.

Gate.io	https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/38656	Institutional & VIP	Gate Global Taker Incentive Program: Futures & Spot Taker Rates Update (2024.9.1)	"
Gate.io officially announced a new Global Taker Incentive Program offering fee discounts for institutional clients. This program offers fee discounts on both futures and spot taker orders up to 8%. The program will start from 1st Sep 2024 and be valid until 30th Nov 2024.

#### Target Audience
Institutional clients with a cumulative spot or futures taker trading volume exceeding $200 million in any single month since 2024.

#### Key Benefits
‚óè **Taker Fee Discounts:** Achieve significant discounts on taker fees for both spot and futures trading by meeting monthly taker volume requirements.
‚óè **Institutional Loan Benefits:** Enjoy preferential interest rates on institutional loan services.

**Program Mechanics**
‚óè **Tiered Discount Rates:** New participants will be categorized by their historical monthly taker trading volume since 2024.
‚óè **Discount Application:** The Gate Key Account Manager will apply the corresponding discount rate based on the assigned tier upon your request.
‚óè **Monthly Taker Trading Volume Assessment:** Participants' monthly taker trading volume will be evaluated to ensure their eligibility for the program's benefits. Failure to meet the required volume will result in discount tier and taker fee discounts adjustment. For example, if Client X whose futures taker trading volume in Aug is 5 billion, applies Tier3 discount in Sep successfully. Therefore client X will enjoy an 8% off discount in Sep. If his actual futures taker trading volume in Sep is 2 billion, which falls in the taker trading volume range of  Tier1, as result, the Tier1 discount rate (4%) will be applied to clientX in Oct.

**Discount Rate Tier and Criterion **

**Futures**

|  Tier   | Monthly Futures Taker Trading Volume($)  | Taker Discount rate  |
|  ----  | ----  |----  |

Gate.io	https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/38255	Institutional & VIP	Gate.io API Rate Limit Policy Update for Enhanced Perpetual Futures Trading	"
Dear Gate.io API Users,
In our ongoing commitment to optimize resource allocation and enhance the trading experience, we announce an update to the rate limit rules for our Perpetual Futures API, effective from 8:00 on August 5th, 2024 (UTC).

The platform will implement rate limiting for trading activities that involve frequent order placement, cancellation, or modification with a low fill ratio over a short period. The specifics are as follows:
‚óè The order placement (POST /futures/{settle}/orders) and order modification (PUT/futures/{settle}/orders/{order_id}) API endpoints will be subject to a rate limit, capped at a maximum of 10 requests per 10 seconds.
‚óè The system will perform a continuous evaluation of trading behaviors. Upon detection of a strategy adjustment that aligns with our efficiency benchmarks, the rate limit will be automatically lifted within a two-hour timeframe.

We encourage all users to adhere to the new API usage guidelines and express our gratitude for your understanding and support.

Should you have any inquiries or require assistance, please do not hesitate to contact your account manager or contact our Gate Institutional Representatives through Telegram at: @KA_EMEA, @KA_APAC.

The new gradient-based calculation rule for the new borrowing maintenance margin is as follows:
Taking BTC as an example, suppose you have a debt of 20 BTC, and the current BTC index price for BTC is 100,000 USD. Then the maintenance margin requirement for this 20 BTC debt would be calculated as follows: 500,000 * 5% + 500,000 * 6% + 1,000,000 * 7% = 125,000 USD.

For more details on the calculation of the tiered borrowing maintenance margin rate, please refer to:
Multi-Currency Margin Mode - About Margin and Terminology
For real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:
Borrowing Rate and Loan Cap
For the query openAPI documentation on the real-time parameters of the gradient-based borrowing maintenance margin rate for all cryptocurrencies, please refer to:
list loan margin tiers
This adjustment only affects the Unified Account business operations, and other business operations such as isolated position leverage and pledge lending are not affected by this adjustment.

**Important Reminder!**
If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency is lower than the tier corresponding to 10% of that debt size, your account's maintenance margin rate will be increased at the time when the parameters officially take effect, meaning you have obtained a better liquidation price level.

If the USD value of your debt for a particular currency exceeds the tier corresponding to 10%, your account's maintenance margin rate will be lowered at the time when the parameters officially take effect. Please closely monitor your account's risk. If your account's maintenance margin rate falls below 100%, it will trigger liquidation to bring it back to above 100%. If necessary, please be sure to reduce your account's risk in advance. You can choose to deposit more assets, reduce debt size, or reduce contract positions.

Gate.io	https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/39063	Gate Learn	Gate Research: BTC and ETH Weakened Amid September Effect, Ethervista Trading Volume Surpasses $100 Million	"
!(https://gimg2.gateimg.com/image/article/1725592030twi_en.jpg)


This week, BTC and ETH entered a consolidation phase, with short positions dominating the market. The ""September Sell-off"" sentiment has dampened market participants' outlook. Despite this, a few sectors‚Äînotably Privacy and Yield Farming‚Äîattracted capital inflows. Ethervista demonstrated robust trading volume, while Polygon's token upgrade sparked community interest. Unfortunately, Penpie fell victim to an attack, with the perpetrator exploiting a validation vulnerability to steal crypto assets. Looking ahead, upcoming token unlocks and macroeconomic data releases are poised to shape market trends next week.

**Market Analysis: **The crypto market underwent a downward correction this week, with only a few sectors‚Äînotably Privacy and Yield Farming‚Äîshowing strong performance. Outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, combined with Ethereum's weaker performance, have put downward pressure on the market.

**Weekly Spotlights: **Ethervista, a trending project on the meme launch platform, surpassed $100 million in trading volume. The platform's governance token, VISTA, has skyrocketed by 1,500% since its debut. In other news, August saw the second-highest monthly liquidation volume in Ethereum's on-chain lending history, reaching a staggering $436 million.

**Data Highlights: **Bitcoin and Ethereum trended downward, with a major liquidation of long positions on September 4th triggering a consolidation phase. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market held relatively steady, showing only slight fluctuations in market capitalization.

**Market Opportunities:** Lumoz is this week's notable airdrop project. Lumoz is a modular compute layer and ZK-RaaS platform providing a powerful, secure, and flexible computing platform for cutting-edge technologies like AI. It also supports zero-knowledge proof services.

**What to Watch Next Week:** The claim window for EIGEN, the first phase of the EigenLayer liquid staking protocol, will close on September 7th. Fractal Bitcoin, a Bitcoin scaling solution, is set to launch its mainnet on September 9th.

Gate.io	https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/38550	Gate Wealth	Quant Fund Principal Protection Initiative: 100% Principal Protection in 30 Days, Enjoy High Annualized Returns with USDT & BTC!	"
To help new users fully experience the steady growth of quant funds, we're introducing the Quant Fund Principal Protection Initiative.  This initiative ensures the safety of your initial investment while also facilitating returns, guiding you toward a stable investment journey!

**Activity Period**: From now until September 30th

**How to Participate**:
‚óè** Step 1**: During the campaign period, select and successfully purchase a
Quant Fund
product.
‚óè **Step 2**: Hold the position for 30 days. If your investment incurs a loss, we will provide a 100% principal guarantee to ensure your initial funds remain intact. If you are in profit, you have the option to either continue holding or redeem your principal and interest, and reinvest to chase higher returns.

**Principal Guarantee Redemption Process:**
1.If your investment incurs a loss on the 30th day of holding, please fill out
the form
or contact our dedicated financial consultant @Gateio_Matt via Telegram.
2.We will calculate the amount of your loss, which is the difference between the principal at the time of purchase and the assets at the time of withdrawal. Once the difference is confirmed, we will credit the corresponding funds to your account within 7 business days.

**Special Reminder:**
The principal protection qualification is only valid for withdrawals made on the **30th day** of holding, **calculated from the date of purchase until 24:00 on the 30th day.** Withdrawals made outside of this time frame will not be eligible for this principal protection policy.

**Benefits for Existing Purchasers:**
If you are a purchaser who already invested in quantitative funds before the campaign, you are also eligible for this time-limited benefit. In the event that you need principal compensation, please fill out
the form
or contact @Gateio_Matt on Telegram for assistance. Upon verification, you will receive the same principal protection guarantee.

We are confident that by engaging in this initiative, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the long-term value that quant funds can offer. We look forward to your participation and to guiding your investment journey with the sophisticated investment strategies of our quantitative funds.

!(https://gimg2.gateimg.com/image/article/1725007243shoutu.png)

On August 24th 2024 Gate Charity, the global philanthropic nonprofit organization of Gate Group, worked with FENOU ILE Orphanage in Abomey Calavi, Benin to offer books to children at the orphanage through the ""Empowering Minds"" book donation project. Gate Charity's ""Empowering Minds"" project aims to donate books to orphanages in order to foster a culture of learning and empowerment among disadvantaged youth.

!(https://gimg2.gateimg.com/image/article/1725007347twitter-2.png)

The FENOU ILE orphanage is a reception and child protection center located in Benin that currently houses more than 100 children. Gate Charity was pleased to be able to offer books to the children living at FENOU ILE and to provide them with resources to help expand their horizons.

!(https://gimg2.gateimg.com/image/article/17250074524.png)

The objectives of the Empowering Minds Book Donation Project and Gate Charity's donation to FENOU ILE orphanage specifically are to provide orphaned children with access to diverse literary resources and to stimulate intellectual curiosity and a passion for learning. The project also aims to:

- Foster creativity, critical thinking, and imagination.
- Enhance educational opportunities and academic performance and
- Promote emotional well-being and personal development.

Books can be transformative to children who may not have the educational support systems to help them excel. They can serve as educational tools and help stimulate cognitive functions and sharpen problem solving skills. Books can also provide a sense of comfort and hope and help children learn from stories that take them to environments beyond their immediate surroundings. Reading can also introduce children to different cultures and perspectives that they may not have immediate access to otherwise. Finally, books can help children gain access to future opportunities like higher education and can inspire them to develop personal goals and aspirations.

!(https://gimg2.gateimg.com/image/article/1725007482twitter-5.png)

The ""Empowering Minds"" Book Donation Project was created to provide orphaned children with the gift of knowledge and empowerment and to inspire them to achieve their dreams. Donating books to orphanages can change the lives of children and help them to reach their full potential. Join us as we continue to help educate future leaders and intellectuals through the imagination and inspiration found in books.

!(https://gimg2.gateimg.com/image/article/17248389842.png)

Participants played an important role in the festival, completing several main events to commemorate Indonesia's Independence. The flag ceremony, which took place on the second day of the festival, was one of the highlights of the celebration and was attended by children, parents, and Suku Anak Dalam's community leaders. The flag ceremony symbolized the unity and spirit of struggle that is still present in the community today. It reflected feelings and thoughts of patriotism in the hearts and minds of community members and instilled memories of the sacrifices made by previous generations so that Indonesia could be independent.

The festival also included a series of Independence Day Competitions that made the 79th Independence Day particularly memorable for members of the Suku Anak Dalam community. The competitions were included to strengthen the connection between members of the community. Each of the competitions required teamwork and offered entertainment to those participating and to everyone watching as well. Important values like sportsmanship and cooperation were taught to younger participants through these competitive events. Events included sack races, cracker-eating contests, tug-of-war, and other similar competitive activities.

The final main event of the festival was the Carnival/Parade. The theme of the carnival was the ""Spirit of National Heroes' Struggle"". Participants wore costumes and traditional clothing that reflected the culture of the Suku Anak Dalam community which were combined with elements that fit the theme of overcoming the national struggle for independence. The carnival showcased the culture while highlighting the sacrifices made by some of Indonesia's most significant heroes. The carnival involved the youth who participated via art and cultural performances. Youth communities in Jambi participated and the local government whole-heartedly supported the event. Ultimately, participants were left with feelings of pride for their community and their country, and lessons were taught by the older generations to the younger ones. 

#### About Sobat Eksplorasi Anak Dalam (SEAD) Jambi and Suku Anak Dalam (SAD)

Sobat Eksplorasi Anak Dalam (SEAD) Jambi is a Non-Profit Organization engaging with educational inequality and social issues. The main goal of this organization is to eradicate the illiteracy of the Anak Dalam Tribe (SAD).  SAD is one of the oldest ethnic minorities in Indonesia. They live and make a living relying on the wealth of the forest with very strong customs. Unfortunately, at this time, their lives are starting to be disturbed, and they are experiencing various difficulties due to the development of modernization, which has taken away their forest rights. Therefore, literacy education is one of the basic keys they must have to protect themselves from being exploited. Besides, this organization is also a forum for Jambi's youth (volunteers) willing to help locals contribute to their regions and raise awareness of the intended issues. The significant impact achieved has not only eradicated SAD illiteracy, but we have also opened access to formal and informal education for them.

The interactive sessions helped build stronger bonds among the participants and fostered a sense of community.

This essential work helps maintain the high quality of support the center provides. Moreover, the volunteers delivered essential childcare items, including diapers, baby formula, clothing, and educational toys, which are crucial for the children's well-being and their mothers' peace of mind.

###How do Sharkfin products bring you a return?
During the observation period, if the price of the target asset stays within the per-specified price range, investors can earn a higher annualized return. At settlement, the closer the target asset prices are to the upper limit of the price range, the higher the annual return.

If, at 4:00 UTC on the settlement day, the price is above or below the per-specified price range, the product will be settled at the minimum annualized rate of return. If the price always stays within the price range, the rate of return will be determined according to where the BTC/USDT/USDT perpetual contract price falls on Gate.io at 4:00 UTC on the settlement day.

About Leveraged ETF
The leveraged ETF product re-balances to a target leverage if a certain criterion is triggered. When it re-balances, profit will be used to expand the position while the loss will lead to decrease of the position. When trading with ETFs, you do not have to pay a margin. You can simply buy and sell it to enjoy increased exposure like you are trading with leverage. ETF products are managed and hedged in the perpetual contract market. We charge a management fee daily to compensate for the funding payment and trading fee which is incurred at perpetual contract markets.No extra funding fee is charged. By optimizing the fund management, the cost and risks for you to get leveraged exposure are significantly reduced.
Risk Warning
Digital currency prices are susceptible to high volatility, which is even more tangible for the leveraged ETF products. Therefore there is a risk to suffer amplified loss. Please fully understand the product and risks involved before trading. Furthermore, the change of an ETF product is not always about the target times of the underlying asset over a certain time span as the result of scheduled or irregular re-balancing.
An ETF product is hedged in a perpetual contract market, the profit willexpand the position and the loss will decrease the position, which will incur greater friction in a swinging market. Due to the rebalancing mechanism and the holding cost, the ETF is not suitable for long term holding. It has greater fluctuation and higher risk. Please be cautious.
