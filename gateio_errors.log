article_title: Gate.io Supports Frontier (FRONT) to Self Chain (SLF) Token Migration
article_link: https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/38688
According to the Frontier (FRONT) project team, Frontier (FRONT) tokens will be migrated to Self Chain (SLF) at a ratio of  1:1. Gate.io will facilitate this migration and provide seamless token swap services for users. If you currently hold Frontier (FRONT) on Gate.io, no action is required on your part.
**Details:**
1) Gate.io will disable new margin borrowing and crypto loan services for Frontier (FRONT) before August 25, 2024, 08:00 UTC. 
2) Users with ongoing trades in the futures trading market are encouraged to adjust your strategies in advance. From August 26, 2024, 08:00 UTC, the FRONT_USDT futures trading market will switch to a Reduce-only mode.
3) On August 27, 2024, 08:00 UTC, Gate.io will automatically settle open positions at the average index price in the half-hour before the futures trading stops. Any outstanding orders will be canceled automatically. Users with open positions in the futures market should adjust your strategies and close positions before August 27, 2024, 08:00 UTC to avoid automatic settlement.
4) Starting from August 28, 2024, 03:00 UTC, Gate.io will suspend the deposit, withdrawal, and trading services for Frontier (FRONT), including FRONT_USDT, FRONT_USDC, FRONT_ETH, and FRONT_TRY spot trading, quant grid trading, Simple Earn, and margin trading.
5) Users with ongoing Frontier (FRONT) quant grid trading should adjust your trading strategies beforehand. Otherwise, the trades will be terminated automatically before August 28, 2024, 03:00 UTC.
6) Users with assets in Simple Earn may manually redeem them in advance. Otherwise, the assets will be liquidated before August 28, 2024, 03:00 UTC.
7) Users with outstanding Frontier (FRONT) loans in the margin trading market should repay the loans in advance. Otherwise, the loan will be settled automatically before August 28, 2024, 03:00 UTC.
8) Self Chain (SLF) token type: Mainnet
Please note that after this token swap, the total token supply increases from 90 million to 360 million. Gate.io will no longer support Frontier (FRONT) tokens. The listing time for new Self Chain (SLF) tokens will be announced separately after Gate.io completes the listing review.
