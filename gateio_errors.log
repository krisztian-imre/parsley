**(2) Staking Pool: CYCON**
-Total Staking Rewards: 4,575,592 CYCON
-Prize Pool Per Hour: 27,235.66 CYCON
-Hourly Reward Cap Per User: 2,723.57 CYCON

-Unlocking Rule: 100% Unlock
**3.Reward Calculation and Distribution**
(1) CYCON Staking Pool: The system will take multiple snapshots of personal staking amounts hourly, and take the average staking amount as the valid staking amount. Hourly staking reward = (Individual latest 1-hour valid staking amount / Total pool staking amount) Ã— Hourly reward pool
(2) Single-Coin Multi-Mining GT Pool: The system will take multiple snapshots of the participants' GT holdings every hour, calculate the average to determine the effective holding amount, and distribute rewards based on that effective holding amount. Hourly Reward = (User GT Holding Amount / Total User GT Holdings in the Pool) x Hourly Reward for the Pool.
(3) Token rewards will be distributed into the spot accounts of eligible users hourly.
(4) Users can join CYCON Staking Pool or Single-Coin Multi-Mining GT Pool at the same time to earn rewards from CYCON pool and GT pool separately.
**4.Notice**

(2) Users can increase or redeem the staked assets at any time during the staking period. After the user redeems in advance or the staking is completed, the staked assets will be transferred to Simple Earn by default. If this option is unchecked, the staked assets will be redeemed into spot assets. If the amount of redeemed assets is too small and does not meet the minimum subscription amount of Simple Earn, the assets will be automatically transferred to spot assets. Additionally, if Simple Earn does not support the subscription of the redeemed token, the assets will also be automatically transferred to spot assets.
(3) Please update your Gate.io App to the latest version (6.33.0) or higher, or visit Gate.ios official website to join Single-Coin Multi-Mining GT Pool. Before participating in Startup Mining, please ensure that you fully understand the participation rules. Click here to learn more details.

(6) Gate.io reserves all rights to the final explanation.
