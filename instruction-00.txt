Please process the following announcement text and extract the relevant information to produce a structured JSON output with the specified fields.

**Fields to extract:**

1. **id**: A unique identifier for the event. This should be an 8-digit number starting from '00000001' and incremented by 1 for each event.
2. **link**: The URL of the announcement.
3. **parse_datetime**: The datetime when the parsing is performed.
4. **exchange**: The name of the exchange (e.g., 'Binance', 'Bybit', 'Gate.io').
5. **publish_datetime**: The datetime when the announcement was published.
6. **event_type**: The category of the event (e.g., 'Delisting', 'Listing', 'Maintenance'). Use the 'in_category' field as a basis but verify its correctness based on the announcement content.
7. **event_date**: The date(s) of the event(s) mentioned in the announcement. If multiple events are present, include all event dates.
8. **coin**: The symbol(s) of the coin(s) involved (e.g., 'BTC', 'ETH', 'ZKX'). Extract all relevant coins mentioned.
9. **market**: The market pair(s) involved (e.g., 'BTC/USDT', 'ZKX/BNB'). Include all relevant markets.
10. **market_type**: The type of market (e.g., 'spot', 'perpetual', 'futures').
11. **priority**: An integer representing the priority of the event:
    - **9** for high-priority events (e.g., delisting, engine upgrades).
    - **5** for medium-priority events.
    - **1** for low-priority events (e.g., marketing events).

**Instructions:**

- Carefully read the announcement to accurately extract information.
- If the 'event_type' in 'in_category' seems incorrect based on the content, update it accordingly.
- If the announcement contains multiple events, create separate entries for each event within the same JSON output.
- Ensure that all extracted dates are in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.
- The final output should be a JSON object (or an array of JSON objects if multiple events) containing the extracted fields.

**Example Output Format:**
