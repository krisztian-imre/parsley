Extract events from content for every token or trading pair separately in a structured .json response, like:

      "exchange_name": "",
      "event_description": "",
      "start_datetime": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:00:00",
      "end_datetime": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:30:00",
      "product_type": "",
      "contract_type": ""

    },
    {

      "token_or_pair": "",
      "exchange_name": "",
      "event_description": "",
      "start_datetime": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:00:00",

      "product_type": "",
      "contract_type": ""
      "priority_level": ""
    }
  ]
}

don't give back redundant events

if you can't find distinct start date for and event, use publish_date: {publish_date} for start_datetime with (MM:00, SS:00)
if you can't find end date for an event, use publish_date for end_datetime with (MM:30, SS:00)
